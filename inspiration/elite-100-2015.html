                IXL is a tremendous part of my classroom instruction. I implement the math
                component each morning and I also use the program for student differentiation.
                As the class completes other morning work, I assign students specific IXL
                math skills to complete. This works well as a daily spiral review of topics
                learned throughout the school year, as well as a way to focus on topics
                posing difficulties for particular students. These quick daily assignments
                allow me to get almost all students on IXL every day. I also assign
                "Daily Language Arts sessions" to groups of students, particularly during
                silent sustained reading times. Additionally, I love the fact that I can
                quickly assign specific sections in both subject areas in class as tests.
                Since teachers can access student reports and see the results of each student,
                my time is saved in grading. Over the past several years, I have given my
                students weekly IXL math homework assignments to improve their math skills.
                I wholeheartedly believe that using IXL in my classroom has played a vital
                role in the many student success stories that I have seen each year.

                I love that the program provides immediate feedback for my students when
                they enter an incorrect answer. It allows the students to get help while
                the teacher is occupied with other duties.  The detailed reports that
                teachers can access are also extremely beneficial.  This is my favorite
                math resource in class by far! Whenever I am presented with the opportunity
                to spread the word of this great program to new people, I do!

                My favorite feature of IXL is having access to math concepts across grade
                levels that allow me to differentiate teaching mathematics with ease,

                I use IXL for whole-class instruction, but differentiate based on the
                student's needs. For example, if I am teaching writing expressions,
                I will put a list on the board like 4th G.1, 5th U.1, and so on.
                I then monitor my students' progress almost up to the minute with the IXL reports.

                We have healthy classroom competitions. Every Monday morning, I share with the
                entire class the reports on the progress that has been made by everyone. The
                students are so eager to see these reports&mdash;they are front and center,
                looking for their name, and feeling proud of their efforts. They look forward
                to seeing these weekly reports and sharing the results with everyone. I feel
                that this motivates the students to work hard and do their very best.

                My entire classroom takes part in IXL. As a fifth grade team, we enjoy some
                friendly classroom competition. We post the IXL certificates of achievement
                on the bulletin board in the hallway for the students and rest of the school
                to admire. The students feel good about their accomplishments. We will begin
                using the program more extensively as we begin our IXL lab. We are truly
                excited about this!

                Every week, I give my 5th graders a goal of doing IXL homework practice
                for 1.5 hours, including the weekends. On Monday mornings, I pull the prior
                week's report to see who has reached that goal. I assign their work by
                writing one skill number on the board and telling them that I want to
                see them get a gold medal on that skill. This skill is always a
                reinforcement of what we have been learning in math class. After they
                receive a gold medal, they are allowed to choose their own skills to work on
                for the rest of the week. Additionally, I also give my students a goal to do
                at least 5 hours of IXL over the summer. One of the biggest reasons we've
                had such success with IXL in our urban school is because we provide many
                opportunities for students who do not have access to a computer or the
                Internet. We open our classrooms before and after school for any child
                who would like to use the school's computers to achieve their IXL goal.
                At the end of each day, we let students who are waiting for the bus use
                the laptops in the library for IXL practice.  We also open our school
                one morning per week in the summer for students who wish to do IXL.

                I use the usage ranking report feature the most. I pull this report every
                Monday morning to see who achieved their goal for the previous week.
                I love how it ranks the students by time. I can quickly see who has
                achieved the 1.5 hours of work I assigned and who did not. The students
                love to know who was at the top of the list each week. This motivates many
                of the students to spend more time on IXL, as they all want to be in one
                of the top slots. I also find the IXL site in general to be extremely easy
                to align to the units of study that I am teaching in math. The way the skills
                are broken down and described makes it simple to quickly select the skills
                I want my students to practice. I write the corresponding letter and number
                on my whiteboard for all to see.

              <p>
                Each week, I let my students know if they've reached their assigned goal
                on IXL.  Students who've reached the goal are given a small reward,
                like a pencil, an eraser, or a classroom privilege.  For those who do
                not meet the goal, I conference with them to find out how I can help
                them achieve it for the following week. Our school also does IXL recognition at
                the end of each month and trimester. The students who complete all of their
                summer work, which includes 5 hours on IXL, can participate in a
                back-to-school reward (this past year was a school dance). Most importantly,
                I have high expectations and let students know how much I think practice on
                IXL can benefit their learning. This has made all the difference in
                my classroom.

                on each skill. Their IXL grade is an average of their points,
                and IXL makes up a third of my students' entire math grade.
                In the spring, before testing, I have students work at their

                I use IXL for homework. I have my students work on the
                concepts we are currently applying in the classroom. I also allow them
                to navigate the grade levels on their own and choose the skills that
                they would like to work on. This way they can still have
                direction from me, but they can also feel more empowered in their learning.

                I use IXL in my math stations.  Every student does the IXL
                station for 12-15 minutes a day.  I assign a skill
                and they work to get it to 80%.  Some of my special
                education students work to get it to 60%.  At least once a
                week we look at a few problems from IXL on the smart board
                together, and they solve them on their personal white boards.  Then
                they get a chance to work that same skill on their iPads.
                In addition to math station time, they work on IXL during
                remediation/enrichment time at least twice a week.  They can work
                with a friend if they get up to 80%.  The kids love to help each other.

                and has motivational features that students enjoy. For example, my students
                love anticipating which prize they will earn. I also love all of
                the reports that are right at my fingertips. Finally, IXL has
                bridged the gap between the classroom and the home. Parents see exactly
                what is expected of their students.

                I have a classroom economy set up. Students are paid for doing
                their work just like I am paid to do mine. Students receive
                $10 for reaching 90% and $20 for reaching 100%.
                I have also created educational "degrees" students can earn. For
                example, they can earn an "Associates" degree. I have
                placed IXL on each degree. This allows advanced students to work ahead
                of the class.

                At the end of the year, in order to review for math,
                I put my students in teams and they compete to win a lunch
                on me. I assign them the 6th grade library and they work
                at their own pace. The group that masters the most objectives wins.

                I was having trouble giving students enough individual practice in the areas they
                each needed. This program allows students who get the concept to move
                on and the ones who need extra practice can do extra problems and
                get extra instruction to meet their needs. The students experience the extra
                instruction in a little bit different way from the Smart Board activities and
                teacher led instruction.

                Accountability is reward enough. They learn to love seeing their own progress
                and seeing that their practice matters. Small group problem solving becomes so
                fun when they already have the math concepts practiced.

                the most helpful as they give details about how every student is progressing.

                I direct my kids to IXL for practice after teaching a skill.
                With the feedback I get from IXL reports, I am able to
                differentiate my class and assign my students extra work based on grade level
                (either higher or lower levels). I make sure that my class's
                IXL site doesn't show the grade level; rather, I
                have it showing by letter. This helps me when I assign students
                work from lower grades as they do not feel discouraged to be doing
                work from the grade they passed. I also assign IXL for homework
                and check the reports every morning before class to see if there are
                any students that need extra attention.

                stay focused. The explanation given when students have gotten a problem wrong
                is also very helpful. The medals and awards the kids earn from
                IXL are also very motivating. The students are always looking forward to
                seeing what award they will get next.

                I appreciate that students receive immediate feedback about their success on a
                problem. I encourage students to reach out to peers, parents,
                or myself when they're having trouble to find alternative strategies that
                will work better for them. I also like that IXL progressively gets
                more difficult towards the end of mastery and that students are expected to
                get the last 10 consecutive questions correct before achieving a 100 SmartScore.
                I feel this motivates students to check their work and think about their
                work in a more critical manner before submitting their solutions.
              </p>
              <h4>Making it fun:</h4>
              <p>
                To motivate my students, I give them classroom cash rewards when they receive
                a 100 on any of the required skills for the week. Students
                are further motivated by earning classroom cash for completing optional
                acceleration skills that are on or above grade level as well as completing
                enrichment skills. Finally, students can receive a "Free Friday"
                if they earn a 100 on ALL of the skills prescribed by the
                end of the week. Typically, I choose 1 to 3 skills,
                depending on the difficulty of the skills. This motivates students to use
                a bit more of their "choice" learning time on IXL during
                the school week if they finish early in the mornings or during their
                math block. In the past, my classes have also been extremely
                motivated by the county-wide contest sponsored by IXL for a pizza party!

                Sometimes it's a game of who can get the answer first, and other times
                I leave it on the board while students are completing other assignments.

                I use IXL in both language arts and math. For language arts,
                I have the students do a Daily Language Review (DLR) and
                assign them skills that are aligned to that DLR. For math,
                I use IXL both in class and for homework. In class,
                we will do a few sample problems on the board, then the
                students have to complete the skill individually before we move on to the
                next activity. I also use IXL for students who are struggling with
                a particular skill. For instance, if a student does not understand
                a topic they should have already learned, I will have them go
                back and complete a skill from the prior grade level.

                I love the fact that you can take the grade levels away and
                replace them with letters. This makes it easier for the students when
                I ask them to review a concept that might be below their grade level.

                My favorite IXL features are the ability to differentiate, and the reports.
                I love that in my classroom I can have students working on the
                skills that they need. My students range in ability and needs.
                I can reach the needs of ALL of my students easily through IXL.
                For example, I have had one student working on preschool skills,
                another on 1st grade, the majority on the 2nd grade skill,
                and a few working on 3rd and 4th grade skills. I can
                fill the gaps of the students who need extra practice and I can
                push the students who need to be challenged. The IXL reports make
                it easy to track who has learned the skill and who needs some
                remediation. With a quick glance, I can see who needs extra
                instruction and I can provide it immediately without having to grade or group
                the students myself. It is all done automatically, which gives me
                more time to provide support for my students.

                My students enjoy having IXL "Jam Time". We turn off the
                lights and turn up the music. The students love to sprawl out
                on the floor and work in the dark. We also have a "Top Five" board and
                a "Most Improved" board. Students with the most points for
                the week can be in the top five, and students who improved
                the most also get recognized.

                so detailed and provide so much information is a huge asset and a
                major reason why I love the program. The graphs allow a visual
                for a whole group goal. The breakdown of the goals using color-coding
                provides the students with exactly what they need to see.

              <p>
                As a class, we celebrate all learners every day on IXL.
                We have class homework goals and we celebrate and cheer when goals have
                been met and when students have made gains. Students are given
                "Class Dojo" points for completing homework and extra points for exceeding
                the homework expectation. As a school, we celebrate and recognize the top
                performing classes on IXL.

                To motivate my students I do class competitions. The class that has
                the most students to complete the assigned lessons on IXL is rewarded.
                I also give students opportunities for bonus points for lessons that address a

                that standard.

                from the book. Students receive a grade for their IXL completion.
                If they receive at least proficient they get 5 out of 5 possible
                points. They will also receive 5 out of 5 possible points if
                they work on each assigned lesson for half an hour. This shows
                us that they worked diligently, but are still not understanding the concept,
                so we can go back and reteach. IXL works great as an
                informal assessment! We love using IXL because the students are able to
                see their mistakes and how to fix them. When they just do
                problems from the book, they have to wait until their work is
                graded to receive feedback.  With IXL, it is instant feedback!
                IXL supports what is taught that day in class, and helps the
                children work at their own level.

                I love that I can log in and see the progress my students
                are making.  I also love how IXL explains how the problems can
                be corrected if students get them wrong.  The SmartScore technology is an
                added plus, as I really feel it gives a good idea of
                how the students are performing.

                I use IXL in a variety of means that range from whole-class, small-group,
                and one-on-one.  Our district is one-to-one with technology, so we
                have the benefit of being able to use IXL however we choose.  Students are
                also assigned homework that is typically centered around IXL and the
                skills from the school day.

                I use IXL as a means of tracking students' strengths and areas
                of difficulty. IXL allows me to focus my lessons according to individual
                and class needs rather than on the next planned lesson for the day.
                I also use IXL as a portion of class and homework activities,
                and as a means of tracking work habits as well as specific math
                skills. I encourage students, as well as parents, to use
                the data that IXL gathers to view and monitor their own progress so
                that they can become proactive learners by celebrating their accomplishments
                and seeking assistance when troubles arise. Since IXL displays the underlying math
                concepts for each question, parents often feel empowered to help their child
                with their math homework. Suddenly, the "new math" difficulties
                that parents find challenging become easier to understand. Parents often tell me
                that they enjoy using the software with their children, and they wish
                that they had had IXL when they were in school. This daily
                conversation about mathematics and children's education as a whole has helped
                foster a learning community between our students, our parents, and our school.

                I appreciate the data that IXL gathers on each student so that I
                can focus my teaching on skills that are most in need of attention.
                I also value that achievement is evaluated through the SmartScore system which
                evaluates skill level according to skills mastered rather than a percentage of right
                and wrong answers. I appreciate that this program allows my students to
                work and progress according to their abilities and to find explanations to questions
                they find difficult when I'm not able to help them at home.

              <p>
                IXL is used in my school as a math intervention activity. It
                is usually for 30 minutes each day and the students work individually,
                in small groups, or as a whole group depending on the students' needs.
                I assign skills for students to work on that are tied to the
                math standard that they are currently learning. I regularly use the skills
                to introduce the new lesson as a whole group before letting them work
                independently. IXL has been a valuable tool, as it allows me
                to see what skills the students have mastered. I can then determine
                who to work with in smaller groups for a more effective intervention time.
              </p>
              <h4>Favorite teacher tools:</h4>
              <p>
                I like many IXL features. The one I use most frequently is
                the reports on skill proficiency; this allows me to have a quick
                snapshot of where the class is in their understanding of a skill or
                standard.   I have also liked the recent addition of starring certain skills.
                This allows me to highlight the skills I want students to work on.

                Students then record their scores when they have reached 90 or better for
                my signature and a sticker. I have done individual rewards, like
                stickers or even a sweet treat, for completing an especially difficult skill.
                As a whole group, if everyone in the class completes a skill
                or series of skills we can earn extra recess time or free game times.
                These individual and whole class incentives have provided great opportunities
                for students to give peer support (i.e. a student who
                has mastered the skill will peer tutor the peer who is struggling)
                so that everyone feels successful.

                While students are working on the skill of the day, I put
                the skill proficiency report on the big screen and let students work to
                complete the pie chart. As students mastered the skill, they go
                up and update the report using my computer. My students love working
                as team to complete the skills and turn the pie chart green.
                The first time I used this technique my class was working in the
                computer lab and was late for lunch because they were cheering on the
                last student and didn't want to leave until they all finished.
                Once she finished, the pie chart turned all green and the room
                erupted with cheers! Imagine how great that struggling student felt to be
                cheered on in such a way. I left that lab fighting back
                tears of joy, it was incredible!  Additionally, a part of
                my weekly parent letter is devoted to IXL. Each week I would
                list the skills that we were going to focus on that week as
                well as all of the past skills. Parents seemed to enjoy the
                list since it gives them an opportunity to see what we work on
                in class and it helps them focus their efforts at home.

                For my students, the most valuable feature of IXL is that they
                can work at their own pace and on skills that are at their
                appropriate level. Targeted practice is the key to learning. Students must
                be able to work at a level that challenges them without frustration.
                Since IXL gives students the ability to work on skills that are at
                their level they learn at a quicker rate and with less frustration.
                As a teacher, I find the skill proficiency report to be my
                most valuable tool. As students are working, I am monitoring this
                report and identifying students who need my assistance. Once I identify a
                struggling student I am able to go to their side and give them
                the assistance they need. Using paper, I would never have been
                able to meet the needs of my struggling students with such speed and precision.

                Our grade level had a list of skills that we wanted to focus
                on for the year. The skills chosen were skills that seemed to
                cause our students trouble on our standardized testing. The list was put
                up in the classroom and students were encouraged to work on the
                "Weak MEAP" list after mastering the skill of the day. We
                started a grade level challenge to see which class could finish the list
                first and the class that won had bragging rights and an afternoon "fun day".
