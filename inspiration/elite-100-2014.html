                My class likes to do "IXL Sprints." They must start on a skill
                they haven't started working on yet and work throughout the time
                limit (usually about 10&ndash;20 minutes). For each skill they
                master, they get a reward. This can be either the whole class

              <h4>Strategies for success:</h4>
              <p>
                I use IXL for whole group, small group, and homework! When in
                whole group, students will usually have individual whiteboards
                that they write the answer on. They show their answer all at
                once. This is helpful as a formative assessment so that I know
                which students need more small group instruction. During small
                group, the students have different "centers" or assignments to
                work on independently. One of these centers is IXL. I suggest
                skills that we are working on in class, but students may choose
                their own skills if they've already mastered the ones suggested.
                IXL helps with differentiated instruction, as students can work
                on a grade level above if they've mastered the 4th-grade-level
                standards already. I don't assign IXL for homework often as some
                students do not have Internet. However, I use the STAR reports
                to determine what skills each student can work on. I "assign"
                them two to three skills that they should have mastered by the
                end of the week. They have time in the morning and throughout
                the day to work on this&mdash;there is never time to do nothing
                in my classroom!

                cheering for them or a small piece of candy. The students really
                enjoy the sprints because many of them are competitive and enjoy
                immediate rewards.

                Students are assigned one to two 20-minute blocks for IXL
                practice weekly in class on a set schedule. Occasionally we use
                some whole-class computer-lab time to work on assigned skills. I
                encourage students to do IXL for homework as well. Some are able
                to do so; others are not. Each Monday I assign on average four
                skills to complete by Sunday. These are usually related to the
                mathematics instruction or unit of study underway in class. I
                have used the site working with individuals or small groups
                before and after school as well.

                during the week, "I'm in the Hundreds Club!" when they've
                achieved 100% on assigned skills. Sometimes, rather than the
                Hundreds Club, I post recognition for the TOP FIVE based on
                amount of time spent practicing. Our principal honors students
                who have practiced 10 or more hours over the summer and then
                well into the school year at school-wide town meetings. A
                colleague and I send reminder postcards two times during the
                summer to every student in our previous class to practice IXL.
                We also purchased pencils printed with &ldquo;I'm an IXL
                star&rdquo; which we use for incentives. I frequently print the
                bar graphs of usage and share them with students and quickly
                discuss our class usage trends. I always share and post IXL news
                flashes!

                doing in the classroom. Each week I assign IXL homework to my
                students based on what we are learning in class. I adjust the
                requirements based on the individual students&mdash;I may push one
                student to score 100%, while another student may be working to
                achieve 75% mastery.

                to help my class and individual students. They help me to hold

                earning "prizes" and watching their game board fill in! They
                also enjoy the responsibility of having weekly homework
                requirements that they can work on from the comfort of their
                living room. We keep track of all the skills the entire class
                has mastered, we print off the Certificates of Achievement that
                we earn, and once a quarter we set an IXL goal to work
                towards&mdash;which will earn them a reward!

                I use IXL in many ways. After teaching a skill, IXL is a quick
                way to check for understanding. After re-teaching those who need
                it, skills are assigned as homework. The IXL skills reinforce
                classroom learning. After school I teach a remedial class and
                use IXL as a re-teaching tool and to check for understanding.

                I have used IXL in different ways. Because of the new CCSS
                goals, I adapt IXL to fit it in with our district's curriculum
                and curriculum goals. I printed out the IXL page on the grade
                level CCSS goals and I've made checklists out of it. I track the
                students' progress on these checklists. If there is a difficult
                concept or concepts that the students have problems with, I find
                the IXL practice for that goal and I give them extra practice. I
                have used it for whole class instruction and extra practice.
                I've used it to differentiate. I found that my "challenge level"
                group benefits from this more than my lower-leveled students.
                My lower-leveled students get more support from me, while I've
                had my independent-level group work ahead into the next
                grade-level curriculum at times.

                SmartScore. I find that it is very motivating for this
                generation of students. I think it helps build intrinsic
                learning in students. Often, I have students get to 90&ndash;95
                as a goal. They get so many more practice problems than they
                would with a typical worksheet anyway. I find that many like to
                go to 100 and that pushes other students to do it, as well. 5) I
                love that the SmartScore drops when students miss questions. I
                feel that by the time they finally achieve their goal, they have
                truly earned it. 6) I love how there is a breakdown explaining
                how to do the problem and why they missed it. It motivates
                students to read and problem-solve.

                I have been using IXL in my second-grade classroom for about
                five years. I assign about five medals daily. I try to go
                through and pick out the ones that match the CCRS standards that
                we are working on at the time. As soon as our students arrive at
                school, we start rotating them into the classroom to start IXL.
                I have five classroom computers that I can do IXL on. Most days
                I am able to secure our iPad cart also, so that each student has
                access. We spend about 30 minutes each morning working on IXL.
                One of the greatest things about IXL is that it is awesome for
                classroom management. I always have those students that are
                finished before everyone else and they love doing IXL. Also,
                students are always trying to earn their five medals before the
                day is finished, so any spare time that they have they are
                wanting to do IXL. It is a great program. I couldn't imagine
                teaching without it. We definitely attribute our higher math
                test scores to this program.

                I have magnetic cats with the students&rsquo; names on them on
                my whiteboard. I have made a Math Master's ladder with blue
                masking tape. As the students finish a medal, they move the cat
                up. We shoot for five each day and when you are at the top, you
                are a Math Master. At the beginning of the year, I offer a small
                prize when the student reaches the top. As the year progresses,
                I wean them off the prizes and they are just satisfied with
                making it to the top.

                I am using IXL for homework. Each week, I select the topics that
                match the ones we are learning in language arts. Students have
                the entire week to work on the topics and attempt to master them.
                Also, they are not restricted to completing the assignment in a
                particular order. So, there are times that they teaching a topic
                to themselves and reviewing it with me in the classroom.

                As a middle-school language arts teacher, I appreciate the
                varied levels of the topics. If I am introducing a new topic, I
                can begin students on the sixth-grade lessons and move them to
                seventh- or eighth-grade lessons based on their individual needs.

              <h4>Students love IXL, too:</h4>
              <p>
                My students love the celebration banners and awards they receive
                when mastering a topic. It is a clear message of their
                accomplishment that they can revisit anytime.

                I use IXL for enrichment and remediation in my classroom during
                our RTI process. Occasionally, I will assign a specific IXL
                skill to go with the lesson of the day. My students are required
                to master at least two IXL skills per week. If they don't get
                them done at school during the week, then it becomes homework to
                be done by Sunday at midnight.

                I appreciate the learning support that appears after a student
                misses a problem. I really believe that it helps to create
                self-learners that are motivated to figure out what they are
                doing wrong in order to complete a skill.

                I use IXL in every way possible: for whole-class practice,

                having IXL challenges. Sometimes the challenges are in groups,

                that the students need to work together on to achieve 100. The

                My favorite feature of IXL is that as students progress, they
                earn points and if they are incorrect, they lose points. This is
                important to me because I know once the students achieve 100
                points, they have truly mastered the skill. You cannot get to
                100 by chance or with luck. I also love that IXL allows you to
                work in any grade level. That way for my struggling students I
                can have them review skills from third grade, and for my gifted
                students I can challenge them and extend their knowledge by
                using skills and standards from the higher grade levels.

                I have been using IXL in my fourth-grade math classes in a
                variety of ways. At times I use it to deliver mini-lessons.
                Using the IXL app on my iPad, I am able to project it for
                whole-group or small-group instruction. The capability of
                showing my work on the projection screen is very powerful. I can
                highlight key vocabulary and show my computation. As a result,
                students are able to visualize and comprehend the various steps
                required in solving math problems. My students are expected to
                practice assigned IXL skills every night as part of their
                homework which reinforces concepts introduced in class. In
                class, students who complete their math work early are always
                eager to work on their IXL accounts. This promotes fluency and
                accuracy as they master skills!

                When I assign activities for the week or month, I follow up with
                certificates for students who completed all and made it into the
                "100% club." I also create "Exceeded the Expectation"
                certificates for children who complete the assigned and
                additional challenge activities. At the end of the quarter, I
                hang additional certificates in our hallway to announce students
                who did all the assigned activities to 100% for the entire
                quarter. My colleague and I had pencils made that say "I
                excelled with IXL." We give these out to the top five on Monday
                mornings to celebrate those who are working long and hard on
                learning math. What a hit!

                I use IXL in my classroom during math center rotations. Students
                work in teams throughout the week. Spiraling IXL skills into our
                curriculum helps to keep those skills sharp and increases
                student confidence. Students also access IXL from home for
                independent practice.

                I assign IXL to my students for homework, but I allow for time
                in class, so that I can help students when possible. I plan the
                entire year out and give the students calendars, so those who
                would like to move ahead in the curriculum can move at a quicker
                pace. Those who move ahead become peer tutors to the other
                students in the class who may need help. Since I constantly
                update their skills, if I see one that they are all skipping or
                not achieving their 80 SmartScore, I will do a whole-class
                instruction.

                I love many features of IXL. The reports are fantastic and very
                user friendly. The one I use the most is Recent skills, so I can
                keep track of their skills and on the same page it shows the
                number correct and attempted so I can tell if they are
                struggling or guessing. I also like the report that lets me know
                exactly what time they are working on their skills, so I can
                tell if they are on IXL at night or on the weekends or in the
                after-school program. I also appreciate the fact that if the
                students are not correct, IXL will write the solution in detail
                for the students to understand how to work it out correctly.

                level of proficiency and their scores on standardized tests&mdash;the
                plans consist of a series of skills that will strengthen all
                five math areas (number sense, algebra, geometry, data and
                probability, and measurement).

                For me, IXL has been an important component of my teaching for
                it gives me infinite ways to complement my instruction. Students
                using IXL become more skilled at independent learning. As a
                teacher I can assign skills to my students in such a way that no
                matter at which level of proficiency they are, they will improve
                dramatically. I love the idea of having skills for all grade
                levels because that gives me the opportunity to plan specific
                practice for the lower achievers as well as for the higher
                achievers.

                I use IXL as a "special" on the days we don't have one. I'll
                occasionally use it on the Smart Board for whole-group
                instruction. A couple times a week I'll use it for assessment
                purposes also. All students start on the skill they've been
                learning and then they move on to an area of interest or
                weakness. Most students with Internet access take advantage of
                IXL at home.

                use this as an opportunity to confer with students.

                I use IXL for my whole class, and I have set it set up in
                nine-week blocks. I have picked out the standards that I have to
                teach for a nine-week span. Then I match up the IXL sections
                that correlate. I assign the IXL standards for my kids to
                complete in a nine-week period. I keep a chart on the wall with
                all of the sections for that nine weeks on it. Then when a child
                finishes a section, I mark it on the chart. After each section
                is completed, they get a piece of candy and after all are
                completed, I give them a Coke. I use the program in homework and
                small-group work, mainly. When I see a problem with a concept, I
                will put the IXL section on the active board and will do a few
                problems as a whole group to re-teach a concept.

                IXL is a supplement to our Math program at school. After a topic
                is taught, the students are required to complete the lessons on

                IXL is a supplement to our Math program at school. After a topic
                is taught, the students are required to complete the lessons on
                that topic. All of the topics that we teach are on IXL. This
                also applies to Language Arts. I love the fact that what I
                taught in class can be reinforced with IXL. The students enjoy
                going ahead and doing lessons that they know we are getting
                ready to learn, or that they have already mastered. I have an
                IXL Wall of Fame in my room where we keep track of how many
                medals each person has received.

                I love that it encourages accuracy especially when students
                reach the Challenge Zone. It discourages mediocrity, which I
                feel is a problem in today's "Everybody gets a trophy" world. I

                I use it for homework and then where there is improvement
                needed, I form my small groups. My students get homework points
                each week based on the amount of time they spend on IXL. They
                have to complete 20 minutes a day minimally.

                I use IXL in my class as math and language arts homework that
                supports my Common Core curriculum. I have assigned it for
                students to practice difficult concepts that have been taught in
                class. I am experimenting with assigning the work before we
                teach it as well to help the students with their test scores. I
                am constantly experimenting with different ways of utilizing the
                program and motivating the students. I have found it works best
                if you are careful to assign the right amount of work for the
                skill level of your students. Homework skills are my minimum
                requirement, but I allow students to do more work within their
                grade-level skills if they wish to. This helps with
                differentiation for those students who are more advanced.

                I appreciate the e-mail notifications and the detailed reports
                the most. It is beneficial that students are motivated to submit
                answers cautiously in the challenge section in order to pass
                with a SmartScore of 100. This indirectly teaches the importance
                of being certain before they click the Submit button.
