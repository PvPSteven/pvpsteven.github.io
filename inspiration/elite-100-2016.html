                IXL improves the efficiency of my classroom. I use IXL for both remediation and acceleration. I communicate the students' IXL progress with their parents frequently, and the students each set individual IXL goals. We also set class IXL goals. This motivates the students to push each other to use the program both at school and at home.

              <p>
                I use IXL for daily practice as well as for intervention and enrichment. Students can work at their instructional level on the the same concept because of the access to all grade levels. First, I model the concept for the whole group and then the students work independently. I love how IXL has brought the students in my classroom closer to each other. They want to see each other succeed so they help each other out. I absolutely love seeing students teaching other students. I couldn't be more proud. My students are learning skills at a quicker rate because of the practice on IXL. They are given immediate feedback on their progress and are taking responsibility for their own success. I love that it has fostered teamwork among my community of classroom learners.
              </p>
              <h4>Favorite teacher tools:</h4>
              <p>
                I love the Real-Time Center because it allows me to monitor the students as they work. I like looking at the Students Quickview report as it provides me a snapshot of what my students are learning and what they may need additional support with. I also like using the mini diagnostic that pops up under the Skills Practiced report. It provides insight as to which skills are mastered and which ones the class may be struggling with. I love the textbook alignment feature as it allows me to match my curriculum directly with skills on IXL. I frequently look at my state's standards to make sure I am covering the content that will enhance each learner.
              </p>
              <h4>Making it fun:</h4>
              <p>
                I keep a chart of skills mastered at each student's independentlevel. It provides a bit of friendly competition for the students and gives them a goal to strive for.

                I teach math and I use IXL in the classroom daily. When my students come to class, they immediately get out their technology and work on the assigned skill of the day. I [also] assign weekly homework assignments on IXL, [and sometimes] we have classroom competitions. IXL gives immediate feedback which helps me tremendously with large class sizes. I have been using IXL now for over five years, and I know that it works because I have students who have done phenomenally on the end-of-year tests. I bring my IXL data to my administative meetings to show the correlations in student learning as proof that this program really does work each and every year.

                I like the custom date reporting feature and Trouble Spots report. This allows my students to slow down and pay attention to their areas of weakness. As an educator, I use the Real-Time Center to monitor students to ensure maximum learning is occurring. I also like the Recommendations feature. This way, students won't get bored and will stay engaged and on topic.

                The growth that I saw in my students last year was monumental. The number of skills a student mastered reflected in their data for district assessments, class work, and standardized tests. About 96% of students passed ISTEP and 84% scored Pass+! We use IXL in a variety of ways each and every day in our classroom. We are a 1:1 school, so we use digital content as a component of daily work and in our rotational models. Students have a personalized "playlist" in which they have skills they set goals for. As students reach their goals, they track data on their list and choose the next skill to master. We have an "IXL Top 10 Leaderboard" where we highlight students who make the most growth each week. Students get super motivated to come to school early, stay late, or work over breaks to see who can be the next student to reach 100, 150, 200, or 250 skills mastered!

                The fact that students receive immediate feedback is huge, as it allows students to identify misconceptions and correct them on the spot. I love the Real-Time Center as it helps me identify students who may be off task or in need of extra help! I use the Real-Time Center and Skills reports that allow me to easily find groups of students that need assistance with particular concepts.

              <p>
                After working on a specific skill for a week or two, we introduced a few correlating IXL skills in the form of a competition. Students got out whiteboards or notebooks and headed to the gym or cafeteria. As a grade level, we saw which class could master the most skills in a given time frame. Doing this from time to time was a way of motivating our students and finding a way to change the pace of everyday math. On a weekly basis, we form teams, and students earn points for their teams each time they master a skill. The students loved celebrating one another for reaching goals and earning points for their teams!

                I use IXL to complement classroom instruction. After I decide which Common Core standard to focus on, I review the suggested IXL lessons for that standard. IXL lessons are assigned on a weekly basis and count for 35% of students' final grade. Students usually spend the first 15 minutes of class working on IXL. Occasionally, I will give them more time if they are struggling. I encourage them to go back and work on previously assigned objectives if they finish early or are interested in improving their grades.

              <p>
                I am using IXL as part of whole class instruction, homework, small group work, and to differentiate instruction. The most frequent way I use IXL is by teaching a mini skill lesson, and then assigning levels and assignments according to my students' level of proficiency and NWEA RIT scores. In my first year of using IXL, my students' NWEA test scores improved dramatically. I'm in a high poverty area with few resources, so I can say confidently that using technology and IXL made a huge difference. My 8th grade class ended up with 72% attainment in reading. IXL played a big role in that achievement.

                I have used all types of reports offered to analyze student growth and areas I need to focus on. I have to say the best IXL feature would be the Real-Time Center in Analytics. When I give my students an assignment, I go to IXL Analytics and can immediately see if anyone is struggling. If so, I'm able to provide one-to-one support and align IXL accordingly. I also love that I can differentiate the assignments for my students because each of my students has [his or her] own learning style and pace. With IXL offering so many skill and grade levels, I can easily make sure my students are challenged and not frustrated with their assignments.

                I offer incentives like a homework pass or free homework weekend if we reach certain benchmark levels either as a class or individually. I also have contests between small groups to see which group will score the highest most quickly, and I offer prizes as rewards.

                I use IXL for language arts practice to teach and reinforce grammar. I check student journal writing and other writing, targeting any issues that they may display. I also assign one or two IXL topics per week for students to master. They get to decide what their grade will be, by working as much or as little as they choose. I am pretty new to using IXL, however, after my students took the SBAC and ACT Aspire tests, they specifically thanked me for having them use IXL because it was so helpful on their tests.

I also appreciate the ability to sort in various ways, depending on my needs and student needs. [In Analytics] I ususally use the Scores report for a weekly grade. I also look for trends.

                I teach each grade level as a whole group for 30 minutes each day. Students have an accountability folder for keeping track of their progress when the lessons are assigned. I use IXL as a way to reinforce skills that our math series does not cover in preparation for making sure students are ready to succeed for the next grade level and beyond.

I use the Student Quickview report to record progress. This allows me to see completed skills and those that still need to be worked on. It also allows me to talk with the middle school team about the skills students need help with that week.

                I use IXL for classwork and small group instruction. For language arts and math, my students are assigned certain strands they need to master each week. The strands that are chosen reinforce the grammar and mathematical concepts we're learning that week. I truly believe that my implementation of IXL in the classroom helped improve [students' test] scores. I believe IXL has higher, thought-provoking questions than a multiple-choice test or old-school textbook.

I've used the Skills Practiced report to help me keep track of where students are at the end of the week in the assigned skills they were given. I've recently started using the Recommendations feature for my lower students. This helps guide me to skills to work with them on.

                I use IXL as homework and class work. Students work through specific sections that are aligned with class lessons. My students certainly improved last year&mdash;many of them were able to master certain skills that they weren't comfortable with earlier in the year, and were able to perform these skills much quicker and with greater confidence than before.

                I love that IXL allows me to differentiate without spending hours creating differentiated sheets. Depending on student needs, students may go up or down a grade level in order to improve their level of understanding, while also remaining engaged. I also really like that I am able to see what students are doing in "real-time" as it's super useful when they are doing IXL in class, and I project their real-time progress on the screen. It helps to motivate the class to try harder, and gets students to put in more effort due to their competitive nature! I like the Students Quickview report [too] because it gives me a quick glance at how each student is performing and how much time they have spent practicing on IXL.

                I use a "Hall of Fame" checklist that is displayed in the class. Each student that completes the required daily time, along with meeting the minimal SmartScore requirement, gets a check mark. They collect check marks for prizes, as well as a free period at the end of the week.

                I like being able to see how many problems each of my kids has done on each skill and the time spent on each skill. This informs my instructional decisions&mdash;for instance, whether or not I can move on to the next topic, if I should reteach and assign a similar skill on a different level, and which student needs more support and attention.

                I assign IXL skills as part of my homework. The students have some time to work on the skills during school, but it is primarily done at home. [IXL] is a great tool for when students are having trouble grasping a particular concept. Students are always eager to teach other students when they are in need of a little extra help or explanation. Additionally, IXL provides a great way to stretch or push students&mdash;it can get tough in the challenge zone.

                IXL is used in many different ways in my classroom. IXL is mostly used for daily homework where children have a time goal to achieve each night, not a certain amount of problems. It is also used during my math block for students to work on as a self-paced model. It is also used as a differentiation tool for IEP students and for students to set goals based on MAP test data. Students work on their "map goals" throughout the school year on IXL. I have definitely seen an improved mindset and eagerness of my students to continue working on a skill. Many of my students have made gains on MAP testing and were working on 6th grade material. The students enjoy some of the newer features on the iPad&mdash;for example, the ability to annotate on the screen has been well received.

                I really love the reports! The reporting feature is the most helpful to me. I can easily target which topics are troubling students, how long they've worked on a particular skill, and which skills or categories have been worked on the most. The new Dashboard report gives a nice overview of students or the whole class. I really like the Trouble Spots report [because] I can quickly look at what students may still be struggling with. I also like the Score Grid report as it gives a nice spreadsheet that's easy to read and helps with standards reporting. The Progress and Improvement report is also very handy to help drive instruction. I also find the e-mail updates to be very valuable. There are often days that I just don't have time to login to view reports in depth. The helpful e-mails contain updated "real-time" information about my students' progression, improvement over time, weaknesses, and strengths. These amazing reporting tools give me a wealth of information that help me make better instructional decisions based on the data. IXL has made my life easier by keeping all those records for me!

I also post certificates on our class website. Students also color in goal sheets once they have mastered a given skill so they are accountable for setting goals and working towards them.

                In my classroom, I use IXL in a variety of ways. At times, I log on and project problems for whole-class instruction. As a class, we break down problems and talk about how they are written or what is expected. Many times, I use IXL for homework. I have individual and class goals that I set for my students. Unlike paper homework, I don't hear groans when IXL is assigned. We have 1:1 technology, so in class I also have students work at their own pace for practice. Sometimes, with our devices, I will project the Real-Time Center from IXL Analytics and we will race to see how we do as individuals or groups.  I have been using IXL for as many years as I can remember seeing it available. Each year, I see more progress as I learn to better utilize the tools. I think IXL helps to alleviate some of the fear students have of failing or not understanding&mdash;especially in math.

                I love the Analytics section&mdash;it's hard to pick just one area.  Since the addition of Analytics, I feel like I can give students practice that fits their needs. I also really appreciate that our state standards are included so I can make sure students hit these areas hard and work towards mastery in these skills. I use the Scores Report and Skills Report frequently to help me chart, assess, and assign student work. Students get stickers on their chart for meeting certain goals. They enjoy seeing their stickers accumulate and the charts also allow them to take personal responsibility to see what they need to be doing. I use the Questions Log to individually help students. This really comes in handy after the school day when I receive an email or text from a student who is having trouble at home. The Questions Log allows me to work through tough areas with them over email, text, chat, or video messaging.

                One of the things the kids like the most is math challenges when I use the Real-Time Center. I can pit students one-on-one, group-on-group, etc. I try to make it competitive, but light-hearted.

                I use IXL every day. I occasionally use it as a whole class teaching tool, especially after viewing the Analytics report that shows me trouble spots with multiple students. I also assign specific focus areas for all students to work on during our math enrichment/intervention block. This allows students to customize their learning and to reinforce skills that they may be having trouble with. This gives me the opportunity to work with small groups on skills they may be struggling with. I also use IXL as homework. I assign my students a weekly goal of one and a half hours per week and I give them specific areas to focus on that reinforce skills we are working on in class. I take the time at the beginning of each school year to show my students how to use IXL and how to learn from their mistakes. I think it is important that they take the time to review the explanation of any problem they may get wrong, and to continue with the skill until they reach mastery and earn a gold medal. I encourage my students to become self-motivated learners and I show them that with IXL, their learning is endless. They have access to all math skills necessary to be successful in 5th grade and they have access to many other skills that they will encounter in future years. I've had so many students get so excited after earning gold medals in the assigned required areas that they move on to other topics. [My students] use IXL to be self-motivated learners and to master many skills that I would not have time to cover within one school year. I also allow students to come to school early and stay late to work on IXL. I am often pleasantly surprised when I have 10 to 15 students offering to stay on a Friday night to master the necessary skills to be successful. It's not uncommon to see me leaving the school as late as 4:30 or 5:00 with a full group of students that has volunteered to stay and complete IXL. I've seen tremendous growth in many of my students using IXL. We administer a district wide pre-test at the beginning of the school year that shows us the approximate grade level the students are working at. Unfortunately, I have had many students test well below their grade level and those students that utilize IXL always show tremendous growth throughout the year. I also see how IXL can boost confidence in the classroom, and I can see the pride on those students faces as they are realizing their math skills are improving.

                I really appreciate that the IXL skills are aligned to the Common Core Standards. This makes it more meaningful for students and is an easy way to show parents what is expected at each grade level. I also really appreciate the Students Quickview report. This is a nice, easy way for me to see if each student has completed the assigned time for the week and then reach their monthly goal. The students get excited to see how much time they have completed. I also appreciate [the Suggested Skill feature, which gives me] the ability to highlight the star that is next to each skill. This feature keeps my students on task. One of the newest features that I have found extremely helpful is the Student Details report. I like that I can get a quick overview of the skills that each student has been working on, and it also quickly gives me exact times that students have logged on and the number of skills they have shown progress in.

                To motivate my students, I print my Students report each week and display it on the door with the students that have gone above and beyond the assigned time and skills&mdash;they're highlighted as "IXL Stars"! These students receive a small reward from me. Sometimes it's a special snack or something as simple as a pencil or a fancy eraser. I really push the idea of becoming a self-motivated learner, and therefore make a big deal out of those students who master all areas assigned and move onto skills I have indicated that would be helpful to them in their future. My school also does a trimester reward for all students in the school that have gone above the required time. Most importantly, I share stories of former students' success. I try to instill in my students that having high expectations and learning to be a self-motivated learner are traits that will help them be successful in their future years.

                IXL is used to practice the [given] unit's concepts. It is assigned as homework, but I also have a "workday" built in to the week every week, so I can help [during class time] if necessary. I have used the site for 3 years and always see the most improvement in those students who do their homework, which is largely IXL. In general, when students do their work, their test scores improve.

                I love many features on IXL. For the students, I appreciate that they get immediate feedback, so they are not just blindly doing work. It is important that it not only corrects them, but gives them explanations. I use the Students report and the Scores report to update the homework done by students. The Scores report is a great way to see the skills completed by the students in one shot.

                I have found that giving students choices for homework works well. I will assign, for example, "The A's&mdash;complete 6 out of 8."  When it comes time for the IXL competition, I have already talked about it most of the year and they are excited to win.

                I use IXL in all sorts of ways&mdash;it's fluid and ever-changing! After whole group instruction and a few practice questions, we will break off into rotation centers. Our aim is to move forward together as a class. Students aim to get up to at least 60 points on their SmartScore on the assigned skill while they're still at school. If they are having difficulty, they are encouraged to ask a teammate, and then myself [in order to] to develop teamwork and independence. If they are having trouble reaching 60 points, ideally I can help them before they go home for the night. The next day, we look at the Score Grid report and find a couple of examples to clear up any misconceptions. The main improvement I see is confidence and a willingness to see math as a challenge, not something to be fearful of. I can see it in my students and I believe that building confidence allows them to have a strong start in mathematics!

                I appreciate the Score Grid report the most. It gives me a quick snapshot of how many questions it took [students] to achieve their score&mdash;the lower the better. For the students, I ask them to get the first question wrong on purpose so that they can learn something from the IXL explanation. I love this feature because it gives instant feedback to anyone who is wanting to learn from their mistake, as opposed to just moving on to the next question and potentially repeating the same mistake.

                We have class T-shirts made with 26 stars on the back, one for each letter of the alphabet.  When [students] complete a skill level (e.g. Grade 3 F: Multiplication skills), they get to fill in an F in the star. Our goal is to complete all 279 skills in the year.

              <p>
                It all started for me 4 years ago when my 5th grade class went with 1:1 devices via Google Chromebooks. I wanted to find something aligned with Go Math [and] realized that there was actually an alignment that existed for Go Math and IXL Math. Each day, I teach a Go Math lesson and then I post a "playlist" that concludes with the IXL skill that matches the lesson. Students start practicing in class and then finish the IXL skill at home for homework using their 1:1 devices. Students need to get at least 70% on a skill to get extra credit. I began to use the pre-kindergarten skills on IXL with my English learners that were new to the U.S. I also adjusted the IXL level to match the goals on the IEP's for my special education students. All students are making progress at their instructional level. In some cases, I have high-achieving students work on 6th&ndash;8th grade IXL. Another [benefit] is that when kids get an answer wrong, IXL automatically scaffolds the problems and teaches the student to do it properly.
              </p>
              <h4>Favorite teacher tools:</h4>
              <p>
                I review and track IXL data on a daily basis with Analytics. My students are held accountable, and with the Real&ndash;Time Center I can see exactly what each student is working on, how much time they have been on IXL, how many [questions] they have done, and the percentage correct. The Real-Time Center report is very powerful to display onto the whiteboard&mdash;I use it as an exit ticket for lunch or for checking homework from home in real-time.

              <p>
                I use IXL for homework&mdash;now [my students] do not have to take home heavy math books&mdash;and the homework is used as extra credit for their math grade.

                I use IXL as a means for tracking students' strengths and areas of difficulty. IXL allows me to focus my lessons according to individual and class needs rather than on the next planned lesson for the day. I also use IXL as a portion of class and homework activities, and as a means of tracking work habits and math skills. I encourage students, as well as parents, to use the data that IXL gathers to view and monitor individual progress. [My students] become proactive learners by celebrating their accomplishments and seeking assistance when troubles arise. Since IXL displays the underlying math concepts for each question, parents often feel empowered to help their children with their math homework. Suddenly, the "new math" difficulties that parents find challenging become easier to understand. Parents often tell me that they enjoy using the software with their children, and that they wish they had had IXL when they were in school. This daily conversation about mathematics and children's education as a whole has helped foster a learning community among our students, parents, and school.

                I appreciate the data that IXL gathers on each student so that I can focus my teaching on skills that are most in need of attention. I also value that achievement is evaluated through the SmartScore, which evaluates mastery level according to [the types of questions answered] rather than the percentage of right and wrong answers. Another great feature is that IXL allows my students to work and progress according to their abilities and to find explanations to questions they find difficult when I'm not able to help them at home. Also, I greatly value the Real-Time Center report in Analytics, which allows me to analyze live data as students are completing questions in class. Real-time analytics allows me to help students at the exact moment they are struggling with a concept. I [also] use the Students Quickview report to see current trends in my classroom. The data allows me to see if students are struggling because of a lack of effort or if there are any other underlying issues. The graph allows me to have discussions with those students and parents based on data rather than intuition.

                IXL has made me reassess how I teach, [and] has opened my eyes to a brighter light. My use of IXL over the last two years has allowed  my students to excel in mathematics. I have had various students not only complete their current grade level but also complete their next year math requirements. I have had students who have struggled with math concepts in previous years shine in math scores and in other math contests.

In my classroom, I've been able to project IXL onto our interactive whiteboard and complete problems as a whole class or turn it into a friendly team competition making class time fun! I've been using it as a whole class introductional tool and reinforcing lessons taught in class since 2013. While students are completing their various problems, IXL provides question-specific explanations for every problem, and that way students are able to get the problem correct the next time. I appreciate and am always excited to use the real-time feature, which [enables me] to assist my students at home on the exact problem they are having difficulty with in real time! So, IXL has truly been&mdash;and continues to be&mdash;a great addition to our curriculum here at Diamond Minds Transformational Leadership Academy.

              <p>
                I use IXL daily and religiously. Students come in early before school for tutoring, enrichment, or lack of access to the internet at home, and work on IXL for an hour. During class, I use it as guided practice for our lesson for the day. I use IXL a lot for differentiation and to increase students' weak spots according to testing data. I also use it in RTI for students&mdash;it's a huge part of my math class. Last year, almost all of our students met and exceeded grade level on the NWEA assessment. I had a lot of students who were working above their own grade-level on IXL, and they scored in the 80th to 100th percentiles. Our school also has been the highest ranking Level 1+ for the past two years. I attribute a lot to IXL.

              <p>
                I love the Real-Time Center, especially since I have 8th graders and I can hold them accountable. I like the fact that I can see the kids' scores go up and down according to their performance. Also, I like the Trouble Spots report where I can see the problems they missed, so I can plan to help them on their weaknesses and know their strengths. I like the Skills report, where I can show them how long they were on and how many problems they did. I will also show the data from these reports to parents to let them know whether or not their children are working up to their potential and using their time wisely.

              <h4>Making it fun:</h4>
              <p>
                I post the top 5 students from the IXL weekly updates on the wall. I use charts and stickers for the skills they complete&mdash;and yes, 8th graders still love that stuff.

                IXL is currently used for language arts and math in our class every day. I use it like a textbook and for instructional purposes. I also use it for personalization as students may work ahead when they've done well on written exams in math and proven mastery of standards. I have a grid with Common Core State Standards listed for math and then apply the IXL skill to be mastered under that standard. It helps me keep track of mastery for each student, and it also allows me to develop RTI plans very rapidly.

              <p>
                Everything about IXL Analytics helps me drive instruction and meet the needs of individual students&mdash;it helps me personalize their learning. I use all of the Analytics reports. I especially like the Score Grid so I can see who is working toward 80% mastery goals. I love the Real-Time Center because I can keep it on next to me while tutoring, and then I can immediately check the next struggling student. I also like being able to click on individual names and see exactly where they are at in their mastery. They are always so surprised that I know what they are doing! Great stuff! I also appreciate the Common Core alignments and the ability to highlight skills for students to work on.

              <h4>Making it fun:</h4>
              <p>
                I have a "standards" bulletin board with craft sticks. There are pockets for SmartScores of 80, 90, and 100. When they reach one of those SmartScores for skills in a particular standard, they may put their craft stick in the pocket. It's a gentle recognition for daily hard work. I plan to create an IXL thermometer somehow to measure all the skills we master this year! I don't ever assign [IXL] for homework, but I have found that if I say, "Work on your IXL standards, I will reward you for the extra work," that is enough motivation. Rewards are mainly free time to read, work on more IXL, play games, etc.
