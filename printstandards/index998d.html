    <h4>2 Animals have behavioral and structural adaptations for getting food. Structural adaptations include things such as specialized teeth for tearing meat or grinding grasses; specialized beaks for cracking seeds, snatching insects, tearing meat or spearing fish; sharp claws for grasping; keen sense of smell, or long, sticky tongues for reaching food. Behavioral adaptations include actions such as following herds of prey animals, spinning webs or stalking.</h4>

    <h4>3 Animals have behavioral and structural adaptations for protection from predators. Some animals have camouflage that allows them to stay concealed by blending in with their surroundings; some animals look like other animals to avoid being eaten. Structural adaptations include things such as sharp quills, hard shells or antlers. Behavioral adaptations include actions such as staying absolutely still, producing a bad odor, appearing or sounding scary, or fleeing.</h4>

    <h4>4 Animals have behavioral and structural adaptations for surviving harsh environmental conditions. Animals that live in cold climates have insulating body coverings such as blubber, down or thick undercoats that keep them warm. Animals that live in hot climates keep cool by releasing heat from big ears or by panting, or by living underground. Some animals survive seasonal changes by slowing down body functions (hibernating in dens, tunnels or mud) or moving to more favorable conditions (migrating).</h4>
