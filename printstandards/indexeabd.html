Sometimes the effects of erosion are immediate (for example, a flash flood or a hurricane) and sometimes the effects of erosion take a long time (for example, the changing course of a river or the carving of the Grand Canyon).</h4>

    <h4>1 Electric current flows (is transferred) from an energy source (battery) through a continuous loop (circuit) and back to the source. A complete circuit (also called a closed circuit) forms a closed loop that allows electric current to flow; an incomplete circuit (also called an open circuit) has a break in the loop that prevents the flow of electric current.</h4>
    
      
    
  </li>

  <li class="each-category">
    <h4>2 Complete circuits can be made by connecting wires, batteries and bulbs in certain sequences. Circuits are completed only when certain parts of a battery, a bulb or a wire are touching (making contact). Circuit diagrams show the relative positions of batteries, bulbs and wires in complete circuits.</h4>

    <h4>3 Conductors are materials that allow electric current to flow through them in an electric circuit. An open circuit can be completed by inserting a conductive material. If a bulb stays lit when an object is added to an electric circuit, the material is a conductor.</h4>

When the north pole of one magnet is placed near the north pole of another magnet, they repel each other; when the south pole of one magnet is placed near the south pole of another magnet, they repel each other; when the north pole of one magnet is placed near the south pole of another magnet, they attract each other.</h4>

    <h4>5 A magnet's push or pull can cause a magnetic object or another magnet to move without direct contact. The strength of a magnet's attractive force can be measured by recording the number or mass of the objects it attracts or the distance across which it attracts objects.</h4>
